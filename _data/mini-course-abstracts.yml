  title: "Moduli spaces of sheaves: geometry and representation theory"
  abstract: "The purpose of this mini-course is to study moduli spaces of sheaves on a
surface, as well as Hecke correspondences between them. Hecke
correspondences are varieties parametrizing several sheaves on the surface
which only differ at points, and they lead to interesting operators on the
cohomology, Chow groups and K-theory of the moduli spaces of sheaves.
Applications of this picture range from mathematical physics to classical
problems in the algebraic geometry of hyperk√§hler manifolds."

  title: "Category $\\mathcal{O}$, symplectic duality, and the Hikita conjecture"
  abstract: "The category $$\\mathcal{O}$$ for a semisimple Lie algebra can be interpreted geometrically in terms of the Springer resolution, and then generalized to other symplectic resolutions.  These resolutions tend to come in dual pairs whose associated categories are related by Koszul duality.  After introducing these concepts, I will discuss various versions of the Hikita conjecture, which relates the cohomology of one resolution to the coordinate ring of its dual. Lecture notes and exercises are available [on Nick's webpage](http://pages.uoregon.edu/njp/IST.html)."

  title: "Springer fibers: basic properties and applications to categorification"
  abstract: "I will explain a few basic properties of (finite) Springer fibers and indicate  how they show up in categorifications. The focus will be on explicit calculations, (partly outside type $A$) on the one hand and some general philosophy behind the related categorifications on the other hand."
