  title: "Representations and Combinatorics of Weyl Groups from Springer Theory"
  abstract: "Let $$G$$ be a connected, reductive algebraic group defined over $$\\mathbb{C}$$. The celebrated Springer Correspondence gives a bijection between theirreducible representations of the Weyl group $$W$$ of $$G$$ and certain pairs comprising a $$G$$-orbit on nilpotent cone of the Lie algebra of $$G$$ and an irreducible local system attached to that $$G$$-orbit. These irreducible representations can be concretely realised as a W-action on the top degree homology of the so-called Springer fibres. These Springer fibres are geometrical very rich and provide interesting Weyl group combinatorics: for instance, the irreducible components of these Springer fibres form a basis for the corresponding irreducible representation of $$W$$. In this talk, I'll give a general survey of the Springer Correspondence and discuss recent joint work on Kato's Exotic Springer correspondence in Type C."
