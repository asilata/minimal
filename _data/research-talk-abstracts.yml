  title: "Loop Grassmannians of quivers"
  abstract: "This is a joint work with Yaping Yang and Gufang Zhao. An earlier construction generalizes the construction of loop Grassmannians by replacing the data of a reductive group by a based quadratic form. The talk will recast this construction in terms of quivers and use this to quantize the construction."

  title: "Link invariants and matrix factorizations."
  abstract: "Khovanov and Rozansky defined a link invariant called triply graded homology. It is conjectured by Gorsky, Negut and Rasmussen that this invariant can be expressed geometrically by a functor from complexed of Soergel bimodules to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the (dg) flag Hilbert scheme followed by taking global sections. A functor with similar properties has been constructed by Oblomkov and Rozansky using matrix factorizations and it is believed that this functor solves the conjecture. The aim of this joint work in progress with Roman Bezrukavnikov is to relate the two constructions using previous work of Arkhipov and Kanstrup."

  title: "Representations and Combinatorics of Weyl Groups from Springer Theory"
  abstract: "Let $$G$$ be a connected, reductive algebraic group defined over $$\\mathbb{C}$$. The celebrated Springer Correspondence gives a bijection between theirreducible representations of the Weyl group $$W$$ of $$G$$ and certain pairs comprising a $$G$$-orbit on nilpotent cone of the Lie algebra of $$G$$ and an irreducible local system attached to that $$G$$-orbit. These irreducible representations can be concretely realised as a W-action on the top degree homology of the so-called Springer fibres. These Springer fibres are geometrical very rich and provide interesting Weyl group combinatorics: for instance, the irreducible components of these Springer fibres form a basis for the corresponding irreducible representation of $$W$$. In this talk, I'll give a general survey of the Springer Correspondence and discuss recent joint work on Kato's Exotic Springer correspondence in Type C."

  title: "On modular functor and representation theory."
  abstract: "A quantized higher Teichmüller theory assigns an algebra and its Hilbert space representation to each choice of a surface and a Lie group $G$. The modular functor conjecture, as formulated by Fock and Goncharov, predicts how this assignment behaves under cutting and gluing of surfaces. I will outline a proof of this conjecture for $SL_n$ and discuss how different statements on positive representations of quantum groups arise as particular cases of the conjecture. This is a joint work with Gus Schrader."

  title: "Theta functions on moduli spaces of local systems"
  abstract: "We consider the so-called theta basis of the ring of regular functions on moduli spaces of $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$-local systems on Riemann surfaces with (possibly irregular) singularities, whose structure coeﬃcients come from the tropical geometry of the moduli space which here are given by the representation theory of an associated quiver. We will focus on the lowest dimensional examples of such moduli spaces for which three elements of the theta basis which compute the trace of the monodromy of the local systems around particular loops on the Riemann surface embed the moduli space as an affine cubic surface in $\\mathbb{C}^3$. In these cases the coefficients of the deﬁning cubic equation arise from the representation theory of a ﬁnite, affine or elliptic Dynkin quiver."
